# ThreeWeatherMen

ThreeWeatherMen is a basic weather application created by three men, for the sake of learning more on API's. With the help of Open Weather API, we were able to access local weather searched by ZIP Code. The weather/ data captured were in kelvin, Fahrenheit, and celsius. The conversion needed to populate in the collection view which shows the forecast for every three hours. As a bonus, we used a photo API to generate a picture based on the zip code entered.
